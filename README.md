# Resume-projects

Hello! These are just a couple of assignments and projects that I have done through school to help show my skill in R, SQL,
and Python. Though I don't honestly think of myself as an expert. I am still learning and am honing my skills more.
Also, I am currently working on a project in my statistical consulting class. We as a team are helping the school's
academic advising to help classify at risk students, and mostly to see if they were able to improve after visiting advising.
I am just not able to share any data at the time. Thank you considerating me for this position.
