We were seeing if there was a relationship between a studentâ€™s homework grade to his grades on exams and quizzes.
This was due to a request from a professor wanting to see the answer to a question she had. 
That question was if the students were really learning how to do the problems, as they were free to work with others on the homework, 
but not on quizzes and such. This is why we thought that there was no relationship between the two. 
I was able to use my skills I learned through Applied Linear Regression.
